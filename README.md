go-gerber-rs274x
================

A library for parsing gerber rs274x files, and an application to view the resulting images, written in go.

I've added a new executable that can take Gerber (rs274x) files from Kicad and generate Gcodes for LASER exposing photosensitive PCBs.

It's totally in a hacked state at the moment.

In the second image, there are missing pads because the program was not rendering MacroApertures before. So far I've punted by just drawing a rectangle that take up the x/y min/max space of the macro. Maybe I'll work on this, but, it comes out pretty good on my boards.

The Oblong shape is being rendered as a rectangle as well.

There is a lot of room to improve the gcode generation.
